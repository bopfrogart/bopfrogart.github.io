We have all let each other down.

If you are want to the use of such categorization, I am a genXer. A child of the internet era. As such, I remember the time preceding the always online madness that we now live in. One could mark my childhood as the time before the internet was actually a thing, cascading into and through the facination of inconnectivity and the wealth of knowledge. You could learn anything. Read anything. Listen to anything. Be anything you wanted to be. Once a plaything for scientists, the wealthy, and the military, computers slowly became a way of life in my adoloscence.

If any should lay claim to the cultural blossoming of this technology, it is those who lived through it - sparked its ascent - embraced its power. However, it is exactly that generation which allowed the potential of this resource; the curation of all preserved knowledge, to be sullied and left untapped. It is the greatest failure of our generation.

We are only human after all.
