Emacs is the answer to so many questions I have been asking!

I am beginning my experiments with emacs because I had a few problems, namely:

1. I research and perform similar tasks over and over, so
2. I require a note taking system
3. I need to organise in a central manner
4. My machines will not all run the same software
5. I desire a platform which integrates well with other technologies

Emacs solves most of these problems by being so old and well maintained. If it has been done on a computer, it has been adapted to emacs. Inasmuch as it handles note taking, it is a dream. My first steps with the environment have proven worth the work to get to know it, and I still don't know anything. It doesn't matter which computer I sit down at - linux i386 machine, modersn mac, ancient mac, dos machine, or atari running as a terminal - I have the same tools and a similar workflow.

Org-Mode is a god send that I have yet barely scrached the surface of.

To date my organisational workflow consits of sketching out ideas and mindmaps in emacs which I sync over git - just to have access to the same documents everywhere I am.
